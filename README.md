Drafts allows you to share draft entries and/or pages with collaborators without having to create a User for them.

For example, you can create a draft `About Us` page and give folks a URL to view that draft content.

Please note:

* these URLs are public, anyone can view them.
* once the content is published, visiting that URL redirects to the actual content
